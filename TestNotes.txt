Now I saved this file too.

Move everything to C++.

Longitude: "Measuring from the intersection of the ecliptic with the equator."  So how does that change with time?

Check ImageDrawForm.cs.
Doing the DrawBitmap code will help me with future RSA stuff too.
Do DrawBitmap.cs and draw some longitude lines on the Earth.

And apparently there's more Linux on Azure than Windows Server.

I have the velocity vectors in the JPL data, so I can use that
for the coordinate system at that point in its path.


At that basic level of parsing objects, Begin and End is an object.  A subclass of that BeginEnd object would figure out the right method to begin and end it.  It's like making a shape object, but subclasses of that shape object know how to draw themselves in the right shape.  The BeginEnd objects know how to find the right beginning and ending.


It's not "open" if it's not understandable.  If it's obfuscated.
Security means it's clear and understandable.
It doesn't do unintended things like run over a person.
If a company makes a big investment, the security of their investment really means the code has to be open and understandable.

Make a blog section to explain open source alternatives for languages.

_Now_ I appreciate open source after Java became very profitable and Microsoft went in to Azure and the clippy character editor.

Put in an array four bits: Accum out, Carry out, M1, M2.  Four more bits to represent the unknown values.

From those arrays, like single M1[x] array, get 6 bits.

int FindBits( byte? uint? SixBits )

return FoundSixBits;


Then set the arrays from those bits.



Carry In, Accum in, M1, M2, Carry Out, Accum Out.
  Do all possible patterns like:
200000
020000
002000

220000
202000
200200

Like shower curtain rings where you can move past empty zeros.

Do the subtraction each time on the division.


Modular Reduction algorithm is a Division Algorithm.  Sort of.


Make better division algorithms.



Make a blog on blogspot with sections: Top, Project names.  Then edit each one for updates.
