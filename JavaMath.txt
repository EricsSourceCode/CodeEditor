For a matrix, the first subscript is the row, the
second subscript is the column.

Set up an array like this:

Tensor:
The rows of S appear as superscripts.
Columns as subscripts.
Row vectors store basis vectors.
Column vectors store coordinates.



Make Vector operators:
MathVector3

MathQuaternion

MathMatrix4

Any size matrix:

This is modular reduction:
Remainder from Mod32() or Mod64() is a modular
reduction.
